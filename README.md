# M.L-house-price-predection

This is my first M.L made using python, Housing price prediction (M.L) is .ipynb extention file.

Inorder to use this we need a dataset which contains multiple parmeters like size of house, street , Year of construction etc., now, using this parameters this code will predict the best houses with its price.

#Input data:
URL to your input dataset should be added to the variable named 'file_url'.
Now add your parameter in next column (user defined/choosen)


#Uses of this program:
It will be easier to find the best house from the vast number of houses, by comparing the parameters like size, age and all other parameters Indeed they are user choosen.
